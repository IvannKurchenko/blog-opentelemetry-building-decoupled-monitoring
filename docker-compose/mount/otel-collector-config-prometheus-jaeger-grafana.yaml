# This OTEL collector configuration file that aims is to extend initial setup and export telemetry data additionally to
# Grafana stack backend services. In particular, they are:
# - Metrics are exported to Prometheus and (Mimir?);
# - Traces are exported to Jaeger and Tempo;
# - Logs are exported to Loki.
# It exposes a single OTLP receiver for this purpose.
